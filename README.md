# network_file_system
The project for Internet Techniques course on seventh semester of studies. The goal was to implement server and 
client sides for simplified Network File System protocol, which will allow multiple clients to perform operations, like:
- opening/closing files and directories
- reading from and writing to files
- seting file pointer
- reading file's stat structure
- deleting files
- reading directories - entry lists

All above actions were implemented based on standard C functions.
